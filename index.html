  <p>
    I'm a fourth-year student at UCSD, majoring in Business Economics with a minor in Data Science. 
    In my free time, I enjoy snowboarding and hanging out with my friends. I also love traveling and 
    engaging in outdoor activities. In the future, I want to pursue a career in accounting and finance, 
    along with exploring opportunities in real estate.
